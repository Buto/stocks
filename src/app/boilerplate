The example from chapter 2 of the book Angular In Action

In my view there is absolutely nothing interesting in this repository.

The author developed examples in Angular In Action in an early version of Angular.

I initially attempted to implement this example using Angular 11. This attempt failed because at least some of the book's examples were broken by some version of Angular released subsequent to the writing of this book. Somewhere in my Google research I encountered a recommendation from the author that implementing the book's examples should not be attempted on modern releases of Angular unless the implmenter had more than a novice-level of expertise.

Of course, folks who know what they are doing won't be working their way through the exercises in Angular In Action. I wasted some time to see if I could make these examples work in Angular 11. I failed.

I uninstalled Angular 11.x and installed Angular CLI version 1.3.2 in its place.
